## Supported Versions

- Only the latest workflow on `master` receives security updates. Regenerate your CLI helper from HEAD before filing reports.
- Legacy templates or forks are unsupported unless the issue reproduces on the stack described below.

## Ecosystem & Compatibility

| Component         | Version(s) / Tooling               | Notes                                                                           |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OS baseline       | WSL (Ubuntu 25.10)                 | Shared environment across tracks.                                               |
| Ruby automation   | Ruby 4.0.6 (`.ruby-version`)       | Depends on Ruby stdlib plus any gems declared inside `RubyGem/`.                   |
| Gemfile           | 4.0.16                             | Per-project dependency manifest; versions install via Bundler.                  |
| Bundler           | 4.0.16                             | Resolves and installs the gems declared in the Gemfile.                         |
| Python automation | CPython 3.14.7 (`.python-version`) | Uses Python stdlib; introduce `requirements.txt` if third-party libs are added. |

## Backward Compatibility

- CLI flags and branch-name parsing helpers strive to remain backward compatible within a release line (Ruby 4.0.x / Python 3.14.x). If a breaking change is required, it will be documented in the changelog before release.
- Interpreter versions older than those listed in the Ecosystem table above (for example, prior major releases) are **not supported**, and security fixes are not backported to them.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report issues privately via **GitHub Security Advisory** (preferred) — open through the repository’s **Security → Report a vulnerability** workflow.

Acknowledgement occurs and status updates follow as soon as possible.  
After remediation we publish guidance alongside required dependency updates.
